## ISMN and CYGNSS Data Integration

### Overview

This project involves the integration of data from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS). It consists of two Python scripts that perform specific tasks:

1. **ISMN Data Processing Script**
   - **Script Name:** `process_ISMN_data.py`
   - **Purpose:** Processes ISMN (Soil Moisture) data from Standard Measurement (STM) files, extracting relevant information such as station details, location, depth, date, time, and soil moisture values. The processed data is saved in a JSON file named `ISMN_stations.json`.

   **Requirements:**
   - Python 3.x
   - Standard Measurement (STM) files in the specified directory.

   **Instructions:**
   1. Update the `directory_path` variable with the path to the directory containing the STM files.
   2. Run the script.

2. **CYGNSS Data Retrieval and Integration Script**
   - **Script Name:** `retrieve_CYGNSS_data.py`
   - **Purpose:** Retrieves CYGNSS data from the NASA Earthdata OpenDAP server and and identifies reflections that closely align in both time and space with the measurements recorded by the ISMN stations. The processed data is saved in JSON files named `input_sm_data.json` and `output_sm_data.json`.

   **Requirements:**
   - Python 3.x
   - Internet connection to access the OpenDAP server.
   - ISMN station information in the JSON file named `ISMN_stations.json` (generated by the `process_ISMN_data.py` script).

   **Instructions:**
   1. Ensure the ISMN station information is available in the `ISMN_stations.json` file.
   2. Define start and end dates for CYGNSS data retrieval.
   1. Specify the list of variables to retrieve.
   2. Set the maximum distance between ISMN sensor and CYGNSS location.
   2. Run the script.


### Project Workflow

1. Run `process_ISMN_data.py` to process ISMN data and generate the `ISMN_stations.json` file.
2. Use the generated `ISMN_stations.json` file as input for `retrieve_CYGNSS_data.py` to integrate CYGNSS data with ISMN data, producing `input_sm_data.json` and `output_sm_data.json` files.

### Note

- Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed before running the scripts.
- Ensure to run the scripts in the specified order, as the second script relies on the output (ISMN station information) generated by the first script.
- Update the OpenDAP request URL with valid authentication credentials in the `opendap_request` function.
- Adjust parameters such as the maximum distance, start and end dates, and variable list according to your specific requirements.
